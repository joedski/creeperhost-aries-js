Available API Commands
======================

API commands are organized hierachically, with each Command working only in its parent Section.

This may be out of date by the time you use it.  I have no idea of the stability of CH's Aries API.  Most of this information is pulled from [their wiki summary of the API][ch wiki] and their [PHP example][php example].  If things in reality are not as they seem here, you may have to search for the most up to date documentation via CreeperHost's docs or via your favourite search engine.

Note it does not matter if it is a URL with `uuid` param at the end or anything else, the UUID will be appended to the end regardless.
